# Fullstack-Project
This is project that's extend from my bookshelf RESTFul API
This project using express.js, nanoid, mysql, eslint for the back-end
i'am already try to consume API in front end.
I put some button that will send a request to the API and do CRUD things
I put some simple front validation so don't need call API to much if input are wrong
BTW, The project in master branch, idk why the default branch is main and not master in this github, and now i can't merge LOL
Still learning how to use git and github.
Stay tune the better version of me
